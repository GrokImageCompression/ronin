/**
@file sparse_array.h
@brief Sparse array management

The functions in this file manage sparse arrays. Sparse arrays are arrays with
potential big dimensions, but with very few samples actually set. Such sparse
arrays require allocating a low amount of memory, by just allocating memory
for blocks of the array that are set. The minimum memory allocation unit is a
a block. There is a trade-off to pick up an appropriate dimension for blocks.
If it is too big, and pixels set are far from each other, too much memory will
be used. If blocks are too small, the book-keeping costs of blocks will raise.
